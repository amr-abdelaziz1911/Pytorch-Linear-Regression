# Pytorch-linear-regression
## Objectives:
	- The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between various features of houses (like area, number of bedrooms, etc.) and their prices using linear regression with a neural network in PyTorch.


## Dataset:
	- X : area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea, furnishingstatus.
	- Y : price.


## Dependencies:
The following libraries are required for running this project:
	- PyTorch
	- Pandas
	- Scikit-learn
	- Matplotlib
All dependencies are already available on Google Colab by default.


## Steps to run the code:
1- Clone the GitHub repository:
	-click in the code button in the repository.
	-select Download ZIP.
	- Un-ZIP the folder.

2- Open Google Colab:
	- go to google colab.
	- in the top-left corner, click File > Upload NoteBook.
	- choose the (pytorch.ipynb) file from the local machine.

3- Upload the dataset:
	- upload the dataset (Housing-1.csv) file to the Colab environment.
	- To upload the file, click on the folder icon in the left-hand pane of Google Colab.
	- Drag and drop your (Housing-1.csv) file into the file explorer (file in the downloaded folder from GitHub).

4- Run all cells:
	- After uploading the dataset, go to the Runtime menu at the top of the Colab page.
	- Select Run all to execute all cells in the notebook.
